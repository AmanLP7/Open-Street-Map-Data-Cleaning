            ********* Open Street Map Data Cleaning Project *********
            *********************************************************


Hello, this project is a part of Udacity's Data Wrangling with MongoDB MOOC. The
objective is to take the data in the form of an xml file and clean the data, writing
the required data in json format and finally storing the data in mongoDB. Following 
are the steps involved in the completion of project -:

1. Getting data from Open Street Map
2. Cleaning the data
3. Writing the data in JSON format
4. Storing the prepared data in MongoDB

The full description of steps involved is given below.

## Step 1: Getting the data from Open Street Map



a. What is Open Street Map?

Open Street Map is a collaborative project to create a "free editable map" of the world. The 
data generated by map is the primary output. Map data is collected from scratch by volunteers 
performing systematic ground surveys using tools such as a handheld GPS unit, a notebook, 
digital camera, or a voice recorder. The data is then entered into the OpenStreetMap database.

Some of the popular services using open steet map are -:
1. Flickr
2. Craiglist
3. Tableau

b. How to get the data from Open Street Map?

Data can be easily obtained by first specifying the map area you want the data for, then,
choosing the data from the various downlod formats, and downloading it.

c. Data used in this project?

I've used geographical data for Benagluru city, defined by below corrdinates -:

minlat="12.9313000" minlon="77.5072000" maxlat="13.0250000" maxlon="77.6816000"

The data here is in form of an xml file comprising of several tags, and the information
is present is the form of key and value pairs.

Example -:

<way id="345889568" version="1" timestamp="2015-05-18T08:34:27Z" changeset="31248232" 
uid="2910514" user="akhilsai">
    <nd ref="3525139924"/>
    <nd ref="3525139922"/>
    <nd ref="3525139902"/>
    <nd ref="3525139910"/>
    <nd ref="3525139924"/>
    <tag k="building" v="yes"/>
  </way>


From the above piece of data we can see that the information is present inside the tags
as key and value pairs.

## Step 2: Cleaning the data


a. What is Data Cleaning?

Data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting inaccurate records, getting rid of
irrelevant data, as per as the requirement specifies.
